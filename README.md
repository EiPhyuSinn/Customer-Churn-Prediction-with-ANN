# Customer Churn Prediction with ANN
## Overview
This project predicts customer churn using a simple Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The dataset was imbalanced, so undersampling and oversampling were used to improve the F1-score.

## Steps
- EDA & Preprocessing â€“ Data cleaning, feature encoding, and scaling.
- Handling Imbalance â€“ Applied undersampling and oversampling.
- Model Training â€“ Trained a simple ANN for prediction.
- Evaluation â€“ Improved F1-score after balancing the dataset.
## Libraies 
- TensorFlow/Keras
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
## Results
- Data balancing improved model performance.
- Achieved a better F1-score after preprocessing.
